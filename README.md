covid-19-stats
==============
Python functions to retrieve and display or export Covid-19 stats from [Coronavirus COVID19 API](https://covid19api.com/)

Features
--------
- __Request__ different sets of data from _API_
- __Reshape data__ to fit specific requirements
- Create __dataframes__ with _pandas_ library
- __Plot__ data using _Matplotlib_ library

This is a learning and __showcase project__ that I developed as part of my __learning process__, with a relevant subject as of today.

Development
-----------

To develop this app locally:

1. Make sure you are using python3. If not sure run check running the command 
```console
`python --version`
```

2. Install pipenv for package management and virtual environment (see how to install [here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today)

```console
$ pip install pipenv
```

3. Clone this repository
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/fviaren/covid-19-stats
```

4. Install dependencies
```console
$ pipenv install
```

5. Activate pipenv shell
```console
$ pipenv shell
```

Happy coding!

Functions
-----------------
The functions are divided into **separate files** or modules for better efficiency and to follow best practices. An _interface_ covid_19_stats.py file contains **3 main functions** that will use support functions from other files.

* ### **_summary_df:_**

Returns a dataframe with summary data of COVID-19 cases.
```python
def summary_df(save_df=False) -> "pandas.core.frame.DataFrame"
```

It will:
- request to the api a summary of all countries,
- select data points or total and new cases of confirmed, recoveries and deaths,
- determine the rates of recoveries and deaths based on this data,
- create a dictionary with this data and with it
- generate a dataframe.
- This dataframe can be saved by passing an argument of "True".

* ### **_compare_countries_df:_**

This function returns a dataframe to compare covid stats form 1 or more countries. The dataframe is pivoted for better visibility and analysis. The dataframe may be saved as a csv file.

```python
def compare_countries_df(
    countries=list,
    daily=False,
    last_date=datetime.date.today() - datetime.timedelta(1),
    days_number=30,
    save_df=False,
) -> "pandas.core.frame.DataFrame":
```

**countries:** country ISO2 codes as strings, e.g. ['BR','NO','MA'].

**daily:** defines if the data wanted is by day or accumulated/total.

**last_date:** last date to report, format *"%Y-%m-%d"* e.g. *"2020-11-18"*.

**days_number:** number of days for which data is required.

**save_df:** save dataframe as csv in local directory.

**Limitations:** At the moment this function makes 3 requests per country to the API, one per case status. Due to the rate limitation of 10 requests per second, for more than 3 countries the function will take longer to run with a delay of 3 seconds between a 429 error (too many requests) and the next request (after 3 countries there will be an added request of 3 seconds every 3 new countries) (see TODO section)

* ### **_plot_covid_stats:_**

This function creates a dataframe to compare (or see) Covid-19 stats form 1 or more countries, and plots the data into 3 subplots, one per case status.
```python
def plot_covid_stats(
    countries=list,
    daily=False,
    last_date=datetime.date.today() - datetime.timedelta(1),
    days_number=30,
    save_df=False,
    save_img=False,
) -> None:
```
**countries:** country ISO2 codes as strings, e.g. ['BR','NO','MA'].

**daily:** defines if the data wanted is by day or accumulated/total.

**last_date:** last date to report, format *"%Y-%m-%d"* e.g. *"2020-11-18"*.

**days_number:** number of days for which data is required.

**save_df:** if True save dataframe as csv in local directory.

**save_img:** if True save plot as png file or not (and show it instead)

**Limitations:** At the moment this function makes 3 requests per country to the API, one per case status. Due to the rate limitation of 10 requests per second, for more than 3 countries the function will take longer to run with a delay of 3 seconds between a 429 error (too many requests) and the next request (after 3 countries there will be an added request of 3 seconds every 3 new countries) (see TODO section)

Usage
-----
### As a command line
The _getopt_ module is used here to be able to use this functions as a command line.
This program takes 7 short form options:

Require argument:
- **-c** : countries. If this option is not used, the function summary_df() will be called
- **-l** : last date. In format %Y-%m-%d
- **-n** : days number. A number

- **-p** : plot. If this option is taken, the function plot_covid_satas() will be called
- **-d** : daily
- **-s** : save dataframe
- **-i** : save image

If there is an error witht he options and arguments passed, an exception is raised and the error will be printed. E.g.: `option -l requires argument`, or `option -m not recognized`

If no options are passed, the summary_df() function will be called-

If `-p` is not passed, and countries are passed in `-c`, the compare_countries_df() function will be called

If `-d`, `-s`, `i`, `-l` or `-n` are not passed, the default values will be used

Here some examples to call the program (same examples as in *As a library* section)
